# Live Face Detection with JavaScript
 
Using face-api.js

To test out this project, download the files onto a computer and use the following instructions to run the index.html file on a local test server. Python 3 will be used to do so.
1. open up a new terminal or command prompt window
2. Use "cd" to go to the project directory that was downloaded
3. Run the following: python3 -m http.server XXXX
with XXXX being any series of numbers, such as 1234.

The locally hosted project can now be visited by navigating to either:
http://localhost:XXXX/ or http://0.0.0.0:XXXX/ on any browser.

This was made by following along with WebDevSimplified's tutorial, which offered the following resources:
